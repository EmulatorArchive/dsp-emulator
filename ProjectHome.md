<b>04/12/14</b> - DSP 0.15b2WIP. Windows 32bits, Linux 32bits and 64 bits and MAC OSX 32  bits binary.<br>
<pre>-General<br>
+ Z80: Fixed LDD and LDDR (Was fixed on Spectrum Z80 engine, but I forget to update!)<br>
+ Loading dynamically the necessary libraries. No more errors if the SDL2 library is not present, warns and finishes execution. If Zlib or IPF libraries are not available, do not perform the function but continues execution.<br>
+ Pokey: Started writing chip emulation<br>
+ Lazarus (Linux and OSX)<br>
- Fixed search function within a ZIP, it was doubling the results<br>
- Optional libraries: Zlib and IPF (CAPS Image)<br>
- Needed libraries: SDL2 and SDL2 Mixer<br>
+ Delphi (Windows)<br>
- Optional library: IPF (CAPS Image), the Zlib library is included on Delphi and don't need a external library<br>
- Needed library: SDL2<br>
+ UPD765:<br>
- Fixed length when full track read is selected<br>
- Fixed length when a sector read is selected<br>
- Fixed function that searches for the next id sector ('Tintin on the Moon' loads again on Spectrum +3)<br>
- Fixed when trying to read beyond the end of a track ('Short Circuit', 'Head Over Heels', etc. loads on Amstrad)<br>
- Fixed sector selection when it's deleted and SK is selected<br>
+ IPF: Started writing an interface to the IPF disk format<br>
Amstrad<br>
+ Implemented snapshots. Now load and save in 'SNA' format.<br>
+ Fixed selection of high ROM. If an unmapped ROM is selected by default basic ROM is slected (Fixes 'avant JC 20000', '2112AD', etc.)<br>
+ Some enhancement on Z80 timings, but still are wrong ('Prohibition' loads)</pre>

<b>06/11/14</b> - DSP 0.15b2WIP. Windows 32bits, Linux 32bits and 64 bits and MAC OSX 32  bits binary.<br>
<pre>-General<br>
+ Small cosmetical details fixes (icons, screen sizes, etc.)<br>
+ Lazarus: Modified the use of the Zlib library, now it links the external library, so compiled objects are no longer needed. Zlib libray must be installed on Linux and OSX (Linux 64bit fails).<br>
+ Simplified the creation of audio emulated device, the audio CPU information is saved internally (number and CPU clock), so it is no longer necessary to add it when initializing a sound chip<br>
+ Simplified keyboard system. It is not based on events to see if the key is pressed or not.<br>
+ M68000: Fixed and added the timings of all opcodes<br>
-Spectrum<br>
+ If a snapshot is loaded and that the maximum speed is set, it's reduced to normal speed<br>
-Amstrad<br>
+ Fixed mode 2 display. I can not change the physical resolution of the screen, because there are games that combine several resolutions in the same frame. It is now the color is estimated from the sum of then two real pixels. (Thanks to cpcbegin)<br>
+ Fixed removal of the IRQ when values are modified in the GA. It fixes audio speed and video timings in some games.<br>
+ M6845 video: The address value is calculated with a table. 32k screen display effect and hardware scrolling now work<br>
-Taito SJ HW<br>
+ Fixed audio<br>
-Zaxxon HW<br>
+ Congo: Fixed audio<br>
-Contra<br>
+ Fixed video</pre>

<b>09/09</b> - Parachute Simulator and mariobros emulator for iPhone/iPad.<br>
These last days of holidays, I've done some testing with Delphi XE2 and FireMonkey, which means programs for the iPhone/iPad.<br>
I tried to compile the simulator 'Parachute' (derived from my Lazarus proyect + MADrigal simulator) and the emulator 'mariobros' (derived from my source of DSP emulator).<br>
With the simulator 'Parachute' I haven't had many problems to run, and works quite well with sound.<br>
I can't say the same of the 'mariobros' emulator, in this case if I had some problems, especially with speed. I can't get more than 30fps on the iPhone, but if 60 fps on the iPad. So far, this first version has no sound, and the controls are not too good implemented, but to be a first test is not bad at all...<br>
You can download them in 'Downloads' section, but you need a jailbreak iPhone/iPad.<br>

<b>30/06</b> - DSP Emulator 0.10b1 WIP 29/06<br>
General:<br>
UPD765 - Added some of the specifications EDSK v5: added emulation of the 'weak' sectors (multiple copies of the same sector) and corrected the specification of the 32K sectors ('Corsarios', 'MOT', 'Robocop', 'Buggy Boy', etc.).<br>
Spectrum+3:<br>
Understood in detail SpeedLock+3 copy protection. If the disk image does not include copies of the 'weak' sectors, the emulator simulate them. Understood also the 32Kb sector Opera disk protection. Modified image of 'MOT' for testing and is working properly.<br>
Pacman:<br>
Cleaned and simplified the video system. Fixed a stupid bug, not counted time spent by each frame (hangs after pause and freezes after playing for a while).<br>

<b>15/03</b> - I'm sorry, but DSP WIP will be delayed some days.<a href='http://www.fallasfromvalencia.com'> Here in Valencia we are celebrating Fallas 2010</a>, up to 20/03, at last some holidays!! Maybe I release a new version before weekend... but I don't know.<br>

<b>09/03</b> - DSP Emulator 0.9b5 WIP released.<br>
<b>Finally I found the huge memory reservation bug!.</b> It was the TAPE module, that reserves 12288 (tape blocks) X 131070 (size of block)=1,6Gb of RAM! Now DSP uses pointers, and reserve memory as it's needed (I think it was when added PZX support). Thanks to Davide Michelini (and some forums) to point me to this bug.<br>
I also fixed the sprites in Wardner.<br>
<img src='http://img1.imagilive.com/0310/wardnerd78.PNG'><br>

09/03 - DSP Emulator 0.9b4 for Linux released. Remember this is a WIP version.<br>
<br>
07/03 - DSP Emulator 0.9b4 Released. This final release added TMS-32010 CPU, and one of my favorites arcades Wardner.<br>
<br>
01/03 - Added more M680X opcodes, added drivers for: Spelunker, Spelunker II, Lode Runner, Lode Runner II and Knuckle Joe. Fixed some small bugs.<br>
<br>
This is the last week of WIP, this weekend the final relase of beta 4.<br>
<br>
And now some coding tips: Some days ago reading some forums, I read that DSP consumes so much virtual memory, and testing much deeper I get a surprise... DSP reserves 1,5Gb of virtual RAM! (but doesn't uses it). I compiled DSP with Delphi 2010 and... the same problem! I tested a 'hello world' program and... the same occurs! It's incledible! Delphi reserves a huge virtual memory space without use! This is a Delphi bug, because compiling DSP with Lazarus everything it's OK. I will do more testing, but any help about this is wellcome.<br>
<br>
23/02 - Fixed some bugs on M6800 CPU, added ADPCM to KungFu Master (sound it's more clean now)<br>
<br>
22/02 - Added M6800 CPU series, so KungFu Master have sound (only missing ADPCM)<br>
<br>
15/02 - Saboten Bombers: working 100% only missing sound. Added Bomb Jack Twin, added New Rally X. Added sound and controls to Snow Bros. Fixed sprites and background in Toki. Started the rewrite of M68000 core.<br>
<br>
09/02 - Saboten Bombers: Fixed bugs, decrypted graphics. Only missing sprites, IO and sound.<br>
<br>
08/02 - Fixed some bugs on Spectrum and Amstrad tape/disc loading and main screen resize, a small bug on Spectrum+3 and Spectrum 128, and now remembers the last tape/disc opened.<br>
Fixed Rygar sprites and Psychic 5 initial screen. Fixed and added some opcodes on Motorola 68000. Added Hard Head 2 and Saboten Bombers drivers.<br>
<br>
04/02 - Added DAC to HardHead and fixed bugs in Windows and Linux<br>
<br>
03/02 - Download added: Linux binary (tested on Fedora 11 and Ubuntu 9.04)<br>
<br>
02/02 - Hard Head driver finished, only remains DAC<br>
<br>
01/02 - Xain'd Sleena driver finished, works 99% only remains a very small sprites glitch. Suna driver started, Hard Head begin to work, but missing sound and correct video emulation.<br>
<br>
29/01 - Added basic driver for Xain'd Sleena with sound. Sprites, backgrounds and colors are missing<br>
<br>
28/01 - These days I'm having some troubles with the IO's of Galaga (reaches the main screen, but goes crazy with coin insertion), so I shall change the driver to see if I clear my mind a little, and then return to it.<br>
I'll start with the driver of Suna 8 bits (Hard Head and Hard Head 2) and the Xain'd Sleena driver.<br>
And between all this I will review the drivers posted by Francenm some months ago, Sauro, System1 and Warp-Warp.
